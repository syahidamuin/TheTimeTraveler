                Dr. Elias Turing had retired from a long career as a computer scientist. 
                His days were now quiet — filled with tea, crossword puzzles, and the occasional 
                lecture at the local university.

                One rainy Tuesday, while searching for his old chess set, he climbed into the dusty attic 
                of his countryside home. Beneath a tarp covered in decades of forgotten memories, 
                he found something impossible: a machine humming softly, covered in dials, wires, 
                and a screen blinking <strong>“SELECT ERA: ▾”</strong>.

                “This… this can’t be real,” Elias whispered. But the screen flickered in response: 
                <br><br>
                <strong>“WELCOME, DR. TURING. READY FOR ADVENTURE?”</strong>
